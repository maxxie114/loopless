# list
- Add a video live streaming of the task run from browserbase, and save the recording link so I can directly view the recording from the UI
- Make sure that the self improvement loop is actually working and that gemini is actually using this self improvement loop to improve the browser execution
- Add more mock task using agi inc benchmark /mnt/d/development/hackathon/loopless/benchmarks/agibench
- Currently the UI is not really good at showing the improvement, the UI need to be more straight forwards at showing the improvements, including the feedbacks from weave, the execution steps, the video recording and all 
- The UI is not showing weather it failed or passed, thats also not good....
